## Description
Bark Point is an app designed to help dog owners find the perfect toys suited to their dog's
personality type.

When a users first log in, the app has the user complete a fun, short personality test for their dog. The personality test utilizes **react tinder cards** allowing the user to _drag_ a card right(yes) or left(no) to answer.

Upon personality test completion, a form that takes in more dog data is displayed. After the form is filled and submitted by the user, the user is sent to a **toy box** page where they can favorite toys for their dog. Clicking on the image of a toy will bring the user to that items purchase page on **Amazon**.

Users can also access a **park** page which renders a map of their surrounding area and provides pinpoints for nearby dog parks. Users can also add their own pinpoints for new parks!

Users can access their dog's profiles and add/remove toys on the **profile** page. Users can add another dog on the **profile** or **park** page.

## Installation and Startup <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Npm-logo.svg/1200px-Npm-logo.svg.png" width=5% height=5%></img><a>

1. Fork the **Bajamen/BarkPoint** repo

2. Clone your **forked repo** into your file system

3. Run **npm install** to install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

4. Create a **.env** file in your main directory and install the dotenv package

```bash
  npm install dotenv
```
The **.env** file will house all of your keys and other sensitive information

Variable | Description
--------------|--------------
CLIENT_ID | key from google Oauth
CLIENT_SECRET | secret generated from google Oauth
SERPWOW_KEY | key to use serpwow api (more on serpwow below)
GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY | key to use google maps api
TWILIO_SID |
TWILIO_TOKEN |
FOUR_SQUARE_CLIENT_ID | key from four square
FOUR_SQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET | secret generated from four square
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET |
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_URL |
DB_USER |
DB_PASS |
DB_HOST |
DB_DB |

4. Use **npm run prod** to build webpack and render the client side

## Database <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/452/mongodb.png" width=5% height=5%></img><a>
If mongo is installed, start mongodb server

```bash
  sudo service mongodb start
```

   If mongo is not installed follow the steps on the official website:
   https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

   For creating a publically accessible database, a mongoDB cluster will need to be incorporated.

   A great tutorial to follow for creating MongoDB Atlas clusters can be found here: https://medium.com/@bretcameron/mongodb-a-beginners-guide-8fca0c7787a4.
6. Use **npm run start** to start local server

## API's
Once dependencies are installed and database is configured accordingly, it's time to fill in the missing spaces in the .env file created earlier.
## Serpwow <a href="https://app.serpwow.com/login"><img src="https://serpwow.com/images/android-chrome-256x256.png" width=2% height=2%></img><a>

First on the list of API keys is serpwow. To obtain the API key, be sure to fill out the account creation form on their dev site:
https://app.serpwow.com/signup

An email verification is required in order to create the serpwow account.

Once an account is created, the user will directly be redirected to the dashboard. On the very top right of the dashboard there is a censor-block
which blurs the key from screen view. When the box is clicked, the key is exposed for the key owner's personal use.

## Google Oauth <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en"><img src="https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-brands-1/24/logo_brand_brands_logos_Google_Authenticator-512.png" width=5% height=5%></img><a>

In order to obtain google Oauth, a google cloud account must first be created. Direct to the **#deployment** section of the README and follow the google cloud installation instructions.

When the google cloud account is created, navigate to the developer console. Once in the console, on the left side-bar find the **API's and services** category
and click on **Oauth consent screen**. From there fill out the consent form **WARNING: DO NOT PROVIDE COMPANY ICON IMG**  and once the form is filled in,
click on credentials. Inside, click on **new credentials** and select **Oauth client ID** from the dropdown. Fill out the creation form and a clientID/secret key
will be provided afterwards.

## Google maps  <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation"><img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/google-maps-1-555382.png" width=5% height=5%></img><a>

Obtaining google maps will require a google cloud account in order to proceed. Refer to the **#deployment** section of the README and follow the installation instructions for google cloud.

Once a google cloud account is created, navigate to the cloud developer console. In the console dashboard, there will be a search engine block on the center of the screen. Search for **Google Maps** and the maps API will show up in the suggestion dropdown. When on the API's page, click **Use API** to configure the API to the cloud application.

Under the credentials dashboard for the maps API, the key will be provided.

## Deployment <a href="https://cloud.google.com/gcp/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-skws-all-all-trial-b-dr-1009135&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_109860918967-ADGP_Hybrid%20%7C%20AW%20SEM%20%7C%20SKWS%20%7C%20US%20%7C%20en%20%7C%20Multi%20~%20Cloud-KWID_43700009609890930-kwd-19383198255&utm_term=KW_%2Bcloud-ST_%2Bcloud&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2af-BRDzARIsAIVQUOcUsgxkrXgaTbVAuk2HgDCeece8qtsCL7UevNtrJFKgzGtsKqtY37oaAvYlEALw_wcB"><img src="https://www.gstatic.com/devrel-devsite/prod/vf2803d8fceba443283ee4e8627acfcc1365957a4f42d24f2965d2cb7faab19ba/cloud/images/favicons/onecloud/apple-icon.png" width=2% height=2%></img><a>

Once the application is configured with the appropriate environmental variables and installations, a
deployment strategy will now be implemented.

This application has utilized google cloud for deployment, to begin setting up a personal google cloud
service, follow the guide mentioned below thoroughly to create a new project instance.

```
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/building-app/deploying-web-service
```

Once a new project is fully configured with an app engine, it's now time to set up what the app engine
will read once the application is deployed; the app.yaml.

Let's first create an app.yaml by issuing ```bash touch app.yaml``` in the root directory of the repository.

Inside of the app.yaml, insert the following code below:

```yaml
runtime: nodejs
env: flex

env_variables:
  CLIENT_ID: ...
  CLIENT_SECRET: ...
  SERPWOW_KEY: ...
  GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY: ...
  TWILIO_SID: ...
  TWILIO_TOKEN: ...
  FOUR_SQUARE_CLIENT_ID: ...
  FOUR_SQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET: ...
  CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET: ...
  CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_URL: ...
```

Now, bare in mind that there are environmental variables being declared within the scope of this file. To ensure
security, check the .gitignore previously generated and search for the name "app.yaml", if the name does not exist
inject the name inside the file.

Once the app.yaml is finished, what will be needed next is a .gcloudignore file to ensure that the node modules
directory does not accidentally pass on as data during the deployment stage. Issue the command ```bash touch .gcloudignore```
in the bash terminal and inside the file add **node_modules/** as well as **bower_components**.

Now that the two files mentioned above are configured, it's time to deploy this repository. This task can be done on the
local machine by using google cloud's deployment-ready shell known as **cloud-SDK**.

To install cloudSDK, follow the installation guide on the official site here - https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

Once cloudSDK is officially installed onto the machine, be sure to shell into the right project by issuing the command below:

```bash gcloud config set project my-project ```

When the project is then selected, be sure that the latest dependencies are installed, and the latest pull has been made.

Lastly, enter the command below to deploy the application:

```bash gcloud app deploy ```

A prompt will then pop up in the middle of the deployment staging. Be sure to issue **Y** to ensure that the file path is
correct for app deployment.
